            <p class="p-3">
                In order for you to fully access our Site, we collect your name, mobile number and your email address. This will allow us to directly communicate with you and process all your needs while logged on and browsing the Site. We collect, store and process your data and relay it to third parties whenever you choose to inquire or get to know more about the real estates in our listings. This will allow real estate owners, sellers, brokers, developers and other permitted uploaders to directly communicate with you in order to facilitate your needs and provide you with answers on your requests.
                <br>
                <br>
                Further, we will use the information you provide to personalize your experience at our website; administer your account with us; audit the downloading of data from our website; improve the layout and/or content of the pages of our website and customize them for users; identify visitors in our website; carry out research on our users' demographics; send you information that we think you may find useful or which you have requested from us, including information about our listings and services, provided you have indicated that you have not objected to being contacted for these purposes.
                <br>
                <br>
                Subject to obtaining your consent, we may contact you by email with details of sales promotions, newsletters and alerts, subscription to services, promotional campaigns, awareness campaigns, programs, sponsorships and events. We may also use your personal information for opinion and market research. Your details are anonymous and will only be used for statistical purposes. Any answers to surveys or opinion polls we may ask you to complete will not be forwarded on to third parties. We save the answers to our surveys separately from your email address.
                <br>
                <br>
                We may further anonymize data about users of the Site generally and use it for various purposes, including ascertaining the general location of the users and usage of certain aspects of the Site or a link contained in an email to those registered to receive them, and supplying that anonymized data to third parties such as publishers. However, that anonymized data will not be capable of identifying you personally.
                <br>
                <br>
                If you choose to provide us with your personal information, you consent to the transfer and storage of that information in our servers.

                You may request that we delete your personal data by emailing us at wecare@rise.com. We will endeavor to comply with such deletion requests but in certain circumstances, we will be unable to delete your personal data as we may be required to retain it for legal, regulatory, and/or compliance reasons (and we may not be able to communicate why we cannot delete such data due to confidentiality obligations that we may be under).
